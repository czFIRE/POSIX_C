Demonstration of problems with non-reentrant functions
------------------------------------------------------

The program "pwnam" should print UID of user 0 and 1000 like

    0: root
    1000: xlacko1

However, with a small probability, the getpwuid function shall
get interrupted before context switch and another thread may
overwrite the static data.

Run "make run" which will run 1000 iterations and print mismatching
logins for uid 0, like this:

    $ make run
    0: xlacko1
    0: xlacko1
    ...
